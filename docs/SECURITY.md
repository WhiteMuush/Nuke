# Security Policy

Nuke is a skeleton for offensive security tooling. Anything built on top
of it is meant to be run by authorized testers against systems they own
or have explicit written permission to test. Misuse is the responsibility
of the operator.

## Scope of this policy

This policy covers vulnerabilities **in the Nuke wrapper itself** — the
entry point, the library, the menus and the installer. Examples:

- Command injection via a configuration field that isn't properly quoted.
- Path traversal in the output directory handling.
- Credentials accidentally written to disk or logs.
- Privilege escalation through the installer.

It does **not** cover vulnerabilities in any third-party tools you wire
into the modules. Report those upstream.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue.** Use one of the private channels:

1. [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/WhiteMuush/Nuke/security/advisories/new)
   — preferred, lets us collaborate on a fix.
2. Direct contact via the email address on the maintainer's GitHub
   profile.

Include:

- The Nuke version (commit SHA or release tag).
- A clear description of the issue and the impact.
- A reproduction recipe — exact menu path, target setup, payload.
- (Optional) a suggested fix.

## What to expect

- Acknowledgement within 7 days.
- A discussion of the impact and the proposed fix.
- Coordinated disclosure once a patch is ready. Credit goes to the
  reporter unless they prefer to stay anonymous.
